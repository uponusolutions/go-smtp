(The above line is intentionally blank & delimits contents from headers)
This is a multi-part message in MIME format
(The majority of email clients in 2017 will never show this, as this is
for clients that don’t support MIME format… which is pretty old itself!)

Now we are onto the juicy bit! This is an email, but in plain text. It
wont have hyperlinks, or *bold* emphasis unless your client renders
that. Lines stick to a certain line length because, again, ~legacy~!
Terminals used to be a certain size, so should email! And this faulty
assumption made some email server software have issues with lines longer
than the expected terminal width (with buffers) so they made the
standard encourage wrapping.
The above headers for this /part/ mention quoted-printable, a method of
escaping characters that cannot be shown in the original limited set of
characters that email accepted.
That means that even things like =C2=A3 need to be converted to this
format. (That is a £ for the sake of this demo. This line is technically
corrupt!)
What does multi-part mean? Email you typically send contains 3 unique
messages, one mentioned above for the oldest clients to say your message
is using the new system, another that is plain text, and the common one,
a Web styled version built with HTML. Users with some clients have an
option to view either, to reduce phishing, to make email more readable,
or to reduce storage size.
